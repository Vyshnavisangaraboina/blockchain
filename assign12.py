# Hyperledger Fabric Problem Solving
# Objective
# To design and implement a simple Hyperledger Fabric smart
# contract (chaincode) that manages a personal asset portfolio on a
# blockchain network. The practical focuses on problem-solving
# using Fabric concepts such as assets, transactions, ledger state, and
# queries.
# Problem Statement
# Implement a basic blockchain-based portfolio system where a user
# can:
# • Create assets (e.g., certificates, projects, or tokens)
# • View all assets stored on the blockchain
# • Transfer asset ownership between users
# This practical demonstrates how Hyperledger Fabric solves real-
# world problems like data immutability, transparency, and secure
# ownership transfer.
# Requirements
# Software Requirements
# • Operating System: Windows / Linux / macOS
# • Node.js (v16 or later)
# • Docker & Docker Compose
# • Git
# • VS Code (with Docker and JavaScript extensions)
